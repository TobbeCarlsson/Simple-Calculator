# Simple-Calculator
A simple calculator that is modular and easily expandable

The calculator can easily be tested by compiling 'calculator.py' in a terminal supporting python with the command:

```
python calculator.py
```

after which the operations can be called in the terminal window.

It can also be run directly with a .txt containing every desired operation by compiling 'calculator.py' with the path for the file as an argument:

```
python calculator.py in.txt
```
